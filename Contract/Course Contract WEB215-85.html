<p id="one">I, James Brooks, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2014 WEB215 - Advanced Mark-up and Scripting with my instructor, DI von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for school work, or that I wish to keep private.

I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
<ol>
<li>I will commit to the necessary work for this course, by planning when and for how long I intend to work on this course, and I recognize that on-line does not mean less work- just different work with less parking problems.</li>
<li>I will work to keep up with the work schedule in this class, and recognize that if this is a summer or short-session class it will require DOUBLE the weekly work of a normal class.</li>
<li>If or when I find I can no longer commit the time and energy required, sad I will either switch to audit or drop the class with the registrar, and do us the courtesy of letting us know with a note.</li>
<li>I will backup my work to a device or remote server from my primary computer so that even under the worst of circumstances, I have copies that are not more than a week old.</li>
<li>I will identify a primary and then a backup computer at another location where I can do my work if my primary computer is unavailable for any reason.</li>
<li>When I have trouble or questions, I will post them to the questions forum, with a meaningful subject line, and enough information to help us help I (not just "I'm stuck, please help!") . I will not post questions on assignment forums or other places that we won't find until 3 weeks later. There is no shame in asking - and questions help everyone since these answers are public. If the questions are personal/private, I am welcome to use direct email.</li>
<li>I will not cut and paste any of my classmates work (HTML may be fair game - talk to my instructor). If I do work or collaborate or communicate with others on some assignment, I will identify them, with a simple (so-and-so helped me on this) but will do my own work.</li>
<li>When asked to do something I don't understand or follow, I'll do some basic research and if I don't easily find what I need, I'll post a question to the board. Some thoughtful examples: How to zip a file, where to find certain software, where to buy the workbook. We won't mind answering basic questions so long as the answer is not the first hit on a google search (if it is, it means I didn't try very hard).</li>
<li>I will follow common standards of netiquette, including not using foul language, insulting commentary or sarcasm, unnecessary CAPITAL TEXT, or useless or missing subject lines in posts and/or emails.</li>
<li>Finally, I will help  others and try and have a little fun - and if I can't have fun, I will at least work to not ruin anybody else's good time!</li>
